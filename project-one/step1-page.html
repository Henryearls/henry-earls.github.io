    <h1>1. You (Plato's Republic)</h1>

    <p>
        Plato's Republic, completed in 375 BC, stands as a seminal work in Western 
        philosophy, offering profound insights into the nature of justice, governance, and 
        reality. Set against the backdrop of ancient Greece, the dialogue unfolds as Socrates 
        engages in discussions with various interlocutors, seeking to unravel the complexities 
        of human existence and the ideal state.
